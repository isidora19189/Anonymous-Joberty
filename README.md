# Anonymous-Joberty
Anonymous Joberty is a platform designed to provide trusted company reviews exclusively from individuals who are currently or have previously been employed by the company. To prevent spam and ensure authenticity, each user is allowed to submit only one review. This is achieved using advanced cryptographic techniques, including the Semaphore protocol and Zero-Knowledge proofs, which guarantee anonymity while verifying employment status.
